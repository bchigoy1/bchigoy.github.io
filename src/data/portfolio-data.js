Analyses was performed on a statewide basis where data from all of Texas' modeling areas are combined and on groupings of survey data where data from modeling areas have been compiled into small, medium, and large size areas. The identified similarities, differences, and trends in attraction rates and variances and evaluate them across area types, land use types, and employment types. The project reviewed and evaluated the structure of cross-classification attraction models, assess workplace survey design in Texas, the standardization of area types in Texas for modeling purposes, and how attraction rates and data are used in trip and activity based models.",

The H-GAC Cargo model is a multi-modal model of demand for the transport of goods and services – or freight flows. Where 4-stage passenger models treat the generation and distribution of different trip types (e.g. Home-Based Work, Home-Based Other) separately, Cube Cargo similarly does so for freight but in terms of commodities and by consumption and production. Freight flows are for the region, imports and exports (Texas regions, other states, Canada & Mexico, and Specialty Generators like ports). The model produces regional freight flow estimates for 16 commodity groups based on - Standard Transportation Commodity Classification 2 (STCC2) codes.  Modes modeled include rail and truck (heavy and light). It is the job of the model to then appropriately distribute and match up consumptions and productions and determine if the goods get there by truck or rail based on user supplied inputs. In addition to the freight model component, the H-GAC Cargo produces estimates for other generators of regional truck traffic including service vehicles. This model was developed based on a variety of data sources including Transearch, FAF3, USACE Port flows, BEA labor force productivity data and regional vehicle classification counts.",

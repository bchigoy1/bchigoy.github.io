      title: "About Byron Chigoy",
      content: 'I build transformative data platforms and lead technical innovation and digital transformations in infrastructure and construction planning. My focus is on improving the built environment for all users, and I am passionate about rural connectivity and urban renewal to improve our lives and nurture the environment.<br/><br/> I've pioneered the use of big data in transportation planning, developed systems that have saved billions of dollars in public sector costs, and created products that have transformed how transportation and engineering professionals work.<br/><br/> 
My joy is exploring the natural world and ideas. I studied Great Books at St. John’s College in Annapolis, Maryland. It is this philosophy and humanities background that allows me to see the world, roblems, and solutions slightly tilted and to probe deeper.

I lead from empathy and challenge, learningOver my career, I have had the greatest joy in building and collaborating with incredible teams. I lead from empathy and challenge, knowing what each team member is capable of and understanding their personal goals. From there we dig deep into problem discovery and the goals of the organization or project to deliver an excellent outcome. I very much enjoy watching and helping team members grow and learn. And I enjoy working with them cross-functionally adapting our skills to the challenge. 
While I prefer Agile development I also embrace the spirit of Kaizen, or continuous improvement, knowing that radical or fast change is often counterproductive."
